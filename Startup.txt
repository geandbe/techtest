RUNNING THE TEST

1. After cloning from Git open BlurocketTest solution and build the solution, this step also delivers required libraries via nuget

2. Open the solution property page -> Common Properties -> Startup Project, click Multiple startup projects radiobutton and make Start
   (or Start without debugging) selection wrom Action dropdown lists for the following Projects:
   Blurocket_TecTest, RedisDataStore, VegaDashboard, ViewHubHost; make sure Dashboard.html is set as Startup page for VegaDashboard site
   (VS features these settings in .suo Solution settings file excluded from Git tracking)

3. Open folder 'redis' on Solution level hierarchy and start persistent store by double-clicking redis-server.exe; also may be useful to
   track for some time redis operations performed by the solution by double-clicking redis-cli.exe and then entering monitor command
   into opened window

4. Push any key in ViewHubHost.exe window start-up SignalR

5. Start Winform order stream simulator from Blurocket_TecTest and play with components

6. RedisDataStore.exe allows 2 start-up modes: 
   - no parameters or forceFlush in command line flushes state, persisted in Redis
   - otherwise (any other string in command line) restores persisted state
