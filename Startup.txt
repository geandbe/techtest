DEPLOYING RUNNING THE TEST SOLUTION:

1. After cloning from Git open BlurocketTest solution and build the solution. This step also delivers required 3rd party libraries via nuget

2. Open the solution property page -> Common Properties -> Startup Project, click Multiple startup projects radiobutton and make Start
   (or Start without debugging) selection from Action dropdown lists for the following projects:
   Blurocket_TecTest, RedisDataStore, VegaDashboard, ViewHubHost; also make sure Dashboard.html is set as Startup page for VegaDashboard site
   (VS keeps tidbits listed above in .suo Solution settings file that is excluded from Git tracking)

3. Open folder 'redis' on Solution level hierarchy and fire up persistent store by double-clicking "redis-server.exe"; also it may make sense to
   track at some time redis operations performed by the solution by double-clicking redis-cli.exe and then entering "monitor" command
   into redis-cli window

4. Start all components with VS Start

5. Push any key in ViewHubHost.exe window to kick-off SignalR

6. Activate Winform order stream simulator from Blurocket_TecTest and adjust data flow

7. RedisDataStore.exe allows 2 start-up modes: 
   - no parameters or "forceFlush" given in command line resets data store state to be persisted by Redis
   - otherwise (any other string given in command line) it assumes restoring previously persisted state
